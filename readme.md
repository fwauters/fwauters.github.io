# My Dev Landing Page

You can access it from [here](https://fwauters.github.io).

## Hello, I'm Fran√ßois !

I made this page to train myself to HTML and CSS. From it you can access my Github and Linkedin profiles, as well as some of the work I'm doing. 

I started from the page of [Dinesh Pandiyan](https://dev.to/flexdinesh/create-your-developer-landing-page-with-github-pages---42jk) but I'm adding new features and try some stuff as my formation progress. :wink:
