# My Dev Landing Page

You can access it [here](https://fwauters.github.io).

## Hello, I'm Fran√ßois !

I made this page to train myself to HTML and CSS. From it you can access my Github and Linkedin profiles, as well as some of the work I'm doing. Everything is not responsive yet, but I'm working on it. :wink:

### Thanks

Special thanks to [Dinesh Pandiyan](https://dev.to/flexdinesh/create-your-developer-landing-page-with-github-pages---42jk) who had the inspiration of this landing page, and of course to the BeCode crew who are currently training me.
